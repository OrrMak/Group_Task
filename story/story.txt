A school held a contest for all the kids. The theme for the contest was, 'The nicest thing dad did for me'. Most of the children expressed their emotions nicely but the award winning answer will really bring a smile on your face. In his answer, a small kid wrote Nicest thing my dad did for me was that he married my MOM.
